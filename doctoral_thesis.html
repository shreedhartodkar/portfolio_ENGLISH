      In the field of civil engineering, the detection and characterization of defects (debondings, non-emerging cracks) are important diagnostic 
      elements that influence the maintenance and management of the pavement structure. These defects represent an altered state of the structure. 
      The geometric characteristics of these defects (shape, width and length) as well as their extent and the water seepage induced by these 
      defects are important durability indicators of the structures. This detection makes it possible to locate a possible pathology, to evaluate 
      the state of health of the structure and also predict its evolution. In this context, "pulse radar" systems, also called Ground Penetrating 
      Radar (GPR) have been used for over thirty years to perform non- destructive testing operations in the traffic flow. They not only provide 
      continuous measurement of the thickness of the pavement layer, but also allow the detection of significant (centimetric) inter-layer debondings, 
      and thus determine the location of subsequent destructive structural controls. However, the temporal resolution of conventional GPRs does 
      not allow direct detection of millimeteric interface debondings. Therefore, the objective of this work is to realize an early detection of such 
      defects. My work is thus focused on both the use of ultra-wideband radar (SFR) and the development of artificial intelligence methods (based on 
      supervised learning) to detect thin debondings. Theoretical and experimental approaches (Cerema test pavement slabs and IFSTTAR's fatigue carousel) 
      were realized which have shown the feasibility of detecting fine debondings in pavements.
