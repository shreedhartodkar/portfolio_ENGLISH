      <h3> Freelancing Projects </h3>
      <p>
        During my 10-month freelance engagement in Nantes, from August 2021 to June 2022, I specialized as a Data Scientist and AI Consultant with a focus on geophysical applications. 
        In this role, I provided expert consulting services in data science and AI, particularly for non-destructive testing (NDT) applications. 
        My work involved data processing for ground radar systems and non-invasive evaluation techniques, ensuring accurate and efficient analysis.

        <!-- I also developed a deep learning GUI tailored for pavement monitoring, designed specifically for end-users in infrastructure management. 
        Additionally, I contributed to infrastructure data processing aimed at predictive damage detection and control, helping to enhance the reliability and safety of critical structures. 
        This freelance experience allowed me to apply advanced AI and data science techniques to solve complex challenges in real world projects. -->

      <h3> Doctoral Thesis </h3>
      <p>
        From November 2016 to October 2019, I was a doctoral candidate funded by Cerema (a branch of the French Ministry of Ecology & Environment) and IFSTTAR (now known as Université Gustave Eiffel). 
        My thesis focused on developing machine learning-based methods for damage detection and monitoring through Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). 
        Using Ground Penetrating Radars (GPRs) for data acquisition, I applied advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to create automated damage detection and monitoring systems.
